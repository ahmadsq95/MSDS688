# Project 1 -- Python Warm-up

## Instructions

_Update your report every week_. Let me know you where you succeeded and where you could use more help.  Turn in your progress report as a PDF file and your lab0.py file in the assignments folder for the current week.  So, during week 1 of the class, go to Worldclass > MSDS688 > Assignments > Week 1 -- Project 1.  Please post your questions to the Project 1 discussion thread.

Remember, you get credit by either:

1. Making progress in terms of number of tests passing, _or_

1. Describing the roadblock that has stopped you, the sequence of steps you took to solve it, and the reasons you took them.  Think of applying the [scientific method to programming](https://blog.makersacademy.com/scientific-method-in-programming-3b729c0b3fc3).

## Did you get stuck?

I did not get stuck yet. As I still watching MIT videos and exploring lab files.

## What steps did you take to solve the problem?

Note: Please provide detail of the steps you took, why you took them, and what the results were.  There are usually many steps that need to be taken to solve a technical issue.  

## Did you succeed?  If so, what worked and why?
